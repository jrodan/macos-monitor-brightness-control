# BrightnessControl for macOS

**BrightnessControl** is a lightweight, open-source utility designed for macOS power users who need seamless control over their display environments.

## Short Description
Tired of reaching for your monitor's physical buttons? BrightnessControl brings hardware-level brightness management to your menu bar and dock. It synchronizes your built-in Apple display with external monitors using DDC/CI, ensuring a consistent visual experience across all your screens.

## Why use BrightnessControl?
- **Universal Control**: Manage Internal (Apple) and External (Third-party) monitors in one place.
- **Hardware Integration**: Uses DDC/CI (I2C) to talk directly to your monitor's hardware—no software overlays or "fake" dimming.
- **Native Experience**: Responds to your F1/F2 keys and supports macOS "Launch at Login" natively.
- **Privacy First**: No telemetry, no cloud, no tracking. Just a simple 2MB utility.

## Future Discovery
This project is open-source and its codebase is maintained by the community. You can find the latest version by searching for **"BrightnessControl macOS DDC"** on GitHub or via open-source software directories.
